## Description

Udacimak is a command-line interface tool to download
[Udacity](udacity.com) Nanodegree contents and keep them locally
on your computer.

Udacimak downloads all videos, images, text contents and present them as local
web pages in a similar manner to Udacity classroom website.

Udacimak was inspired after Udacity announced in October 2018 that students who
graduate will no longer have life-time access to the course content. Instead,
all access will be removed 12 months after graduation date. There are also cases
where access to content will be removed immediately after graduation (eg. if
you're an Enterprise or Scholarship student, etc.)

If you want to keep the contents to yourself, Udacimak is built for you;
or if you would like to have a local copy to quickly revise the lessons while
doing the course, Udacimak is also a good option.

We hope you enjoy this downloader.

__Stay Udacious__!

If you find this CLI helpful, please support the developers by starring this
repository.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have `node` and `npm` installed.
  _Install via [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) is highly recommended._
1. Install [`git`](https://git-scm.com/)
1. To install Udacimak, run:

  ```shell
  npm install -g udacimak
  ```

### Update

To update to the latest version, run the same `install` command:

```
npm install -g udacimak
```

## Change Log
We do not generate change log files for this project.

But if desired, you can check changes in a new release by looking at the
[Git commit messages](https://github.com/udacimak/udacimak/commits/master).
The commit messages prior to a version number commit inform the changes
that has been made to that version release.

For example, from the commit messages below, we know what changes have been
made in version `1.1.1`, `1.1.2` and `1.1.3`

```shell
# version 1.1.3 example
afb3ade (tag: v1.1.3) 1.1.3
c0f7b4f Add user agent for requests
ad93fb3 Update README
fdb9b96 Add user agent for requests

```

### Use Udacimak via [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container
There is a [Udacimak image](https://hub.docker.com/r/udacimak/udacimak/) that you can use.
Download the image by running:

```shell
docker pull udacimak/udacimak
```

Udacimak is the `entrypoint` of the image so you can directly use it. Examples:

```shell
# show help
docker container run -it -v "$(pwd)/:/downloads" udacimak/udacimak --help
```

Remember to use [volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) (`-v`)
so that downloaded files are saved onto host machine.

You can also ssh into the container to directly work in their instead by
changing `entrypoint` to `/bin/bash`:

```shell
docker container run --rm -it -v "$(pwd)/:/downloads" --entrypoint /bin/bash udacimak/udacimak
```

Remember to set the `--targetdir` option to the shared volume (eg. `"downloads"`
in the examples above) so that downloaded or rendered contents are saved
directly into the host machine, eg:

```shell
docker container run -it -v "$(pwd)/:/downloads" udacimak/udacimak render "downloads/_json/Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree nd001 v7.0.0" --targetdir "downloads"
```

## How to use

Udacimak allows you to keep Udacity content locally in 2 main steps:
1. __Download__: Download means fetching all JSON data of a course or Nanodegree
from Udacity API and store them locally as `.json` files.
1. __Render__: Render means converting the downloaded course JSON data into
"readable" files. It will download all videos, images and render all contents
into HTML files. You will use these HTML files to view the materials on your
computer.

_Please read further instruction below for detailed usage._

### Contents
- [`settoken`: Set Udacity Authentication Token](#settoken-set-udacity-authentication-token)
- [`listnd`: List your Nanodegree keys](#listnd-list-your-nanodegree-keys)
- [`download`: Download course content as JSON data from Udacity API](#download-download-course-content-as-JSON-data-from-udacity-api)
- [`render`: Render downloaded JSON course contents](#render-render-downloaded-json-course-contents)
- [`renderdir`: Iteratively render multiple JSON course contents](#renderdir-Iteratively-render-multiple-JSON-course-contents)
- [Log Files](#log-files)

### `settoken`: Set Udacity Authentication Token
First, your __Udacity authentication token__
(officially called __JSON Web Tokens (JWT)__)
should be configured so that the
cli can download course contents from Udacity API:

```shell
udacimak settoken YOUR_UDACITY_AUTH_TOKEN
```

Udacity authentication token can be found in Udacity website browser _cookies_.
To get your Udacity authentication, follow these steps:
1. Visit classroom.udacity.com and log in
1. Open the __Developer Tools__ (press `Cmd + Opt + J` on MacOS or `F12` on Windows)
1. Go to __Application__ tab, then __Storage > Cookies >
`https://classroom.udacity.com`__.
1. Find `_jwt` key, its __Value__ is the __Udacity authentication token__.

Alternatively, copy the Javascript code below in the __Console__ in
__Developer Tools__, it will get the token and copy it to _clipboard_ for you:

```js
/**
 * Retrieve cookie by name
 **/
function getCookie(name) {
  var value = "; " + document.cookie;
  var parts = value.split("; " + name + "=");
  if (parts.length == 2) return parts.pop().split(";").shift();
}

// get jwt and copy to clipboard
copy(getCookie('_jwt'));
```

### Security Note
Udacity authentication token is a secret key to is unique to you
and you should not share it publicly.

The secret token also will expire automatically after a period of time.
If you find Udacimak's
`listnd` and `download` commands unusable due to unauthorized error,
try to get the token again from the browser and `settoken` with the new token.

### `listnd`: List your Nanodegree keys

To download the Nanodegrees, you need to know the Nanodegree key to
pass to the command.

Nanodegree key is an id that is assigned to a Nanodegree in the format
of `ndXXX`, `ndXXXt`, etc. where `XXX` is the number assigned to that
Nanodegree. You can see it in the Udacity classroom or catalog url.
The two examples below shows urls of Nanodegree key `nd1337`:

```
https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd1337/syllabus/core-curriculum
```

or

```
https://www.udacity.com/course/cybersecurity-nanodegree--nd1337
```

You can list the Nanodegree keys of the ones you have graduated and currently
enrolled in as such:

```shell
udacimak listnd
```

### Additional Information
Note that you for each Nanodegree you will have an associated version
and language (`locale`) that you can download. Udacity occasionally updates
their Nanodegree content, hence the Nanodegree version. You will only have
access to the latest version at the time you purchased the Nanodegree.

### Course key
Udacity also provides lots of free courses. If you're interested in downloading
these courses, head to https://www.udacity.com/courses/all, click on a course
that you're interested in and get its __key__ in the `url`. For example,
the course key in the `url` below is `ud281`:

```
https://www.udacity.com/course/high-performance-computing--ud281
```

### `download`: Download course content as JSON data from Udacity API

`download` command will fetch all necessary JSON data from Udacity API to
download them and save them locally:

```shell
udacimak download nd001

# or download multiple Nanodegree and courses:
udacimak download nd001 nd002 st101
```

![download Example GIF][example-download]

You can have a peek at these files to see what they contain.
The JSON data files are not "readable". But note that they're the core contents
that you need to save the Nanodegree/course locally to your computer.

To view the content in a readable manner, one could build a web app
that read the JSON files and render it in HTML format. This can be a tedious
process since you'll need to study the JSON structure built by Udacity
to process them. That is why Udacimak provide `render` functionality to
render all the course contents into _static web pages_.

#### Important downloaded directory note
You should not modify the structure of the downloaded directory:
- Do not create new directory inside the downloaded directory.
- Do not render into the downloaded directory.
- Do not rename any `.json` files.
- Not critical, but avoid renaming directory names inside the downloaded
directory.

#### Note regarding workspaces
Udacity has a number of types of workspaces for projects and
quizzes/exercises, including Jupyter Notebook workspaces, IDE workspaces.
The files of these workspaces are not downloadable, so all your workspaces
will not be accessible from Udacimak.

It is recommended that you download them manually. For Jupyter Notebook
workspaces, please refer to this [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48122744/how-to-download-all-files-and-folder-hierarchy-from-jupyter-notebook?rq=1) on how to download all files in one go.

Please also note that some of the workspace materials are available on Udaciy
Github page, so have a peek there first to see if you can clone them.

### `render`: Render downloaded JSON course contents

After you have downloaded all course content as JSON data from Udacity API,
it is now time to convert them into readable format. `render` command is
provided to do this:

```shell
# --targetdir is optional
udacimak render PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_COURSE_JSON_DIRECTORY --targetdir OPTIONAL_TARGET_DIRECTORY
```

__Parameters:__

```
-t, --targetdir <targetdir>  (Optional) Target directory to save rendered course contents
-v, --verbose                (Optional) Force youtube-dl to log debugging information
--userquizanswer             (Optional) Force rendering user's Programming Question code answer
```

![Render Example GIF][example-render]

`render` command will:
- :white_check_mark: Create summary page for Nanodegree and all lessons to easily navigate the
course content and find all lessons
- :white_check_mark: For each lesson:
  - Download all videos (including subtitles), images and create lesson contents as HTML files to
  view on your favorite browser.
  - Create HTML files for labs, project descriptions and project rubrics pages.

It is also :heavy_exclamation_mark: important to know
what `render` is not capable of:
- __Quiz__: for all quizzes:
  - :x: It is not possible to "submit" the quizzes to check for result from
  Udacity API. We simply can't have access to Udacity API to check the quizzes.
  - :x: For a few quiz types, (_Programming Quiz_ and _Image Format Quiz_) there are no solutions provided.
- :x: __Workspaces__: As noted [above](#note-regarding-workspaces), Udacimak
can't download the workspace files for you. So the lesson pages that contain
workspaces will not display any workspace for you.

The process can take a few hours due to large amount of videos to download.
Once it is done, you can enjoy the lessons on your computer:

![HTML Lesson Example 01][example-html-lesson-01]

![HTML Lesson Example 02][example-html-lesson-02]

#### Important render directory note
Do not render into any target locations that are sub-diretories of a
downloaded directory. If you try to do so, the renderer will throw error.
In other words, separate the directories for downloaded and render directories,
do not render into target directories inside downloaded directories.

For example, this is an example of folder structure that will work:

```shell
├── Udacity Nanodegrees
│   ├── # ✔ This directory can be target directory for render command
│   ├── _json/
│   │   ├── # ✔ This directory contains downloaded JSON data using download command
│   │   ├── # ❌ Any render target that points into directories inside _json/ will fail!!!
│   ├── _renders/
│   │   ├── # ✔ Alternatively, this can also be target directory for render command
```

#### Re-rendering a Course
If you cancel the command or the CLI is cut off for some reason (eg. the CLI
stops because internet is disconnected); or when the CLI is updated with new
rendering features (better formatting, fixing missing content, etc.)
you can re-run the render process later.
Just use the same command, the CLI will:
- NOT re-download video/image files that are already downloaded. Only a few
image files may be re-downloaded because the original image url to download
doesn't contain image file name, which means Udacimak won't be able to tell
if those images have been downloaded or not.
- Re-create all HTML files

![rerender Example GIF][example-rerender]

As long as Udacimak sees that the folder name in the `--targetdir` dir (or the
current terminal working directory if `--targetdir` is not provided) is the
same as the source folder that contains course JSON data, it will
think that this is a re-render, and will avoid re-downloading any online
media files that already exist in the course folder.

#### Watching Video with Subtitles
Since `v1.1.x`, Udacimak supports showing subtitles on the videos on the web
video player.
On Firefox, the subtitles should show up normally.
If you use Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge, a web server needs to be set up
for the subtitles to show up.

To set up a web server, you can use
[npm `serve` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve), or Python 3's
`http.server` module, etc.

It is important that you set up a server from the Nanodegree or course's
__root directory__. Otherwise, when going to the lesson pages, they won't be
able to find the `assets` folder to load the required libraries for the web page
to run properly.

__Known Issue:__ On Google Chrome, when viewing the pages with a web server,
you will not be able to "jump" the video. See here for why:
- [HTML5 video will not loop](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8088364/html5-video-will-not-loop/9549404#9549404)

### `renderdir`: Iteratively render multiple JSON course contents

This is a convenient method to render all the courses that you have downloaded.
If you have downloaded Nanodegree/course contents into a single directory,
you can use `renderdir` to render all of them:

```shell
udacimak renderdir PATH_TO_DIRECTORY
```

__Parameters:__

```
-t, --targetdir <targetdir>  (Optional) Target directory to save rendered course contents
-v, --verbose                (Optional) Force youtube-dl to log debugging information
--userquizanswer             (Optional) Force rendering user's Programming Question code answer
```

### Log Files
Please note that the CLI will produce log files in the working directory of
your terminal, including:
- `udacimak.error.log`
- `udacimak.info.log`

The log files will contain the latest CLI output of the commands.
They are limited to 10MB per file

If you face any issue, you may want to share the section of the log file content
that contains error log to the developer when reporting the issue.


## Note to Windows OS users:
The CLI is prone to some known issues when using on Windows:
- 260-character file path limit: When facing this issue, you may have trouble
viewing video file, moving files, etc.
Windows will never fix this file path limitation, so...
- Chinese character in file name: Node application seems to have issue
working with file names that contain Chinese, Portuguese character on Windows.
So, when rendering the course JSON, it may fails to name the Youtube subtitle
files correctly.

It is recommended that you use a Linux system to download and render the
course to make sure all files are processed safely.

If you use Windows, you will need to accept that:
- You will have trouble moving/copying the downloaded/rendered course folder.
Though you can find softwares that can get around this issue for you.
- Some subtitles won't be named according to video files (so that video players
such as [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/index.html) can automatically detect
them)


## Breaking Changes from Udacity API
Because of the complexity of the course structure, the CLI is error prone to
changes being made in Udacity API, especially in a newly released course. If
the JSON structures from the API have changed, we will have to reverse-engineer
again and make update to Udacimak to adapt to the new structure.

Please open an issue in
[__Issues__ tab](https://github.com/udacimak/udacimak/issues) to help us keep
the CLI up-to-date if you face any problems using the CLI.

### CLI Update Note

When Udacimak is updated to a newer version, it may contain new rendering
features. You can check the changes of each version on
[the Commits page](https://github.com/udacimak/udacimak/commits/master)

In this case, you may want to run the render process again.
It should take a few seconds per Nanodegree/course because the CLI doesn't
re-download online media files when re-render a course.
Also see [note above](#re-rendering-a-course)


## Reporting Issues

Before reporting any issues, please make sure you're using the latest version
of Udacimak first:

```shell
# show current version
npm list udacimak
# or
udacimak --version

# update udacimak
npm install -g udacimak

# check current version
udacimak --version
```

If the issue persists, please open issue in
[__Issues__ tab](https://github.com/udacimak/udacimak/issues).
Please give us as much information as you can.
However, note that you should not provide
your Udacity authentication token to anyone - it's a secret token of your
own account.


## User Privacy
Since you will have to provide the secret Udacity authentication token for the
CLI to work, the CLI does have access to your personal information via Udacity
API, including name, email address, graduated/enrolled nanodegrees, etc.
The token is saved in the CLI config, located at:

```
# for Linux
~/.udacimak

# for Windows
%USERPROFILE%/.udacimak
```

However, these details are only used internally in the app to serve its
functionalities. None of your personal details, as well as the secret
authentication token, will be sent to anybody else.
